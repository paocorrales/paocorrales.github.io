**Abstract:**
Microwave cloud polarized observations have shown the potential to improve precipitation retrievals since they are linked to the orientation and shape of ice habits. Stratiform clouds show larger brightness temperature (TB) polarization differences (PDs), defined as the vertically polarized TB (TBV) minus the horizontally polarized TB (TBH), with ~10 K PD values at 89 GHz due to the presence of horizontally aligned snowflakes, while convective regions show smaller PD signals, as graupel and/or hail in the updraft tend to become randomly oriented. The launch of the global precipitation measurement (GPM) microwave imager (GMI) has extended the availability of microwave polarized observations to higher frequencies (166 GHz) in the tropics and midlatitudes, previously only available up to 89 GHz. This study analyzes one year of GMI observations to explore further the previously reported stable relationship between the PD and the observed TBs at 89 and 166 GHz, respectively. The latitudinal and seasonal variability is analyzed to propose a cloud scattering polarization parameterization of the PD-TB relationship, capable of reconstructing the PD signal from simulated TBs. Given that operational radiative transfer (RT) models do not currently simulate the cloud polarized signals, this is an alternative and simple solution to exploit the large number of cloud polarized observations available. The atmospheric radiative transfer simulator (ARTS) is coupled with the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model, in order to apply the proposed parameterization to the RT simulated TBs and hence infer the corresponding PD values, which show to reproduce the observed GMI PDs well.
