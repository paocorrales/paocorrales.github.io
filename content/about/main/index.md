  I have a PhD in Atmospheric Sciences from the University of Buenos Aires. During my PhD I applied data assimilation techniques to improve the representation of mesoscale convective systems and associated precipitation. I haves experience working with Numerical Weather Prediction models using HPC systems and programming languages such as R, bash, and Fortran.
  
  
  I've been a trainer and instructor for [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) since 2020 and now I'm also part of their Board of Directors. I'm an RStudio certified instructor since 2019. I've contributed to translations projects of Carpentries’ materials and the book [Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/). I'm currently contributing to the translation of R message in R base and recommended packages and the Internationalization of R Help Pages project.
  
  I'm part of [Expedition Science](https://expedicionciencia.org.ar/), an Argentina-based NPO, where I lead educational projects such as science camps and workshops for students and K-12 science teachers. I was part of the board in the role of treasurer from 2013 to march 2024 and now I hope to continue contributing to their governance and organization.
  
  I'm a professor at the Data Sciences degree courses at Guillermo Brown University where I teach Data Visualization and Data Management courses. I develop openly licensed materials to teach and learn R from scratch, reproducibility for researchers and other topics in free-range settings.
  
  I'm part of the R-Ladies Global team, the LatinR community, and I co-founded [MetaDocencia](https://www.metadocencia.org/), a teaching community for Spanish-speaking educators. Currently, I am also part of rOpenSci, where I translated the [Development Guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/es/index.es.html) and co-authored the [rOpenSci Localization and Translation Guidelines](https://translationguide.ropensci.org/). In 2023, I participated in the Champions program presenting the [agroclimatico](https://github.com/AgRoMeteorologiaINTA/agroclimatico) R package to rOpenSci peer review process.

  The image in the home page depicts Richardson’s “forecast factory” by L. Bengtsson. Richardson imagined a round theater filled with people who would calculate the finite differences at each point on the globe needed to solve the Navier Stoke equations and thus generate a weather forecast. The first 6-hour forecast took him a week and it was totally wrong. Today we have very accurate forecasts that are generated hourly. However, we are still using the principles that Richardson envisioned.
