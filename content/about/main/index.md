intro: |
  I have a PhD from the University of Buenos Aires. I study Atmospheric Sciences applying data assimilation techniques to improve short-term forecasts of severe events in Argentina. I've been a trainer and instructor for [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) since 2020 and an RStudio certified instructor. I've also contributed to translations projects of Carpentries’ materials and the book [Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/). I'm currently contributing to the translation of R message in R base and recommended packages.
  
  I'm part of [Expedition Science](https://expedicionciencia.org.ar/), an Argentina-based NPO, where I lead educational projects such as science camps and workshops for students and K-12 science teachers. I'm a professor at the Data Sciences degree and postgraduate courses at Guillermo Brown University where I teache Data Visualization and Data Management courses. 
  
  I'm also part of the R-Ladies Global team, the LatinR community, RForwards and I co-founded [MetaDocencia](https://www.metadocencia.org/), a teaching community for Spanish-speaking educators. I develop openly licensed materials to teach and learn R from scratch, reproducibility for researchers and other topics in free-range settings.

  The image in the home page depicts Richardson’s “forecast factory” by L. Bengtsson. Richardson imagined a round theater filled with people who would calculate the finite differences at each point on the globe needed to solve the Navier Stoke equations and thus generate a weather forecast. The first 6-hour forecast took him a week and it was totally wrong. Today we have very accurate forecasts that are generated hourly. However, we are still using the principles that Richardson envisioned.
