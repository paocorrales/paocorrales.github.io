## About rOpenSci

rOpenSci fosters a culture that values **open** and **reproducible** research using **shared** data and reusable software

## My role in the community

I'm part of the [Multilingual Publishing Project](https://ropensci.org/multilingual-publishing/), as a reviewer of the Dev Guide translations project to Spanish. I'm also one of the authors of the [rOpenSci Localization and Translation Guidelines](https://translationguide.ropensci.org/), that explains all the steps and tools involved in the localization of rOpenSci's materials, including translations.

During this year (2023), I've been part of the [Champions Program](https://ropensci.org/champions/), as a [champion](https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/04/13/ropensci-champions-program-teams-meet-pao-corrales-and-adam-sparks/). My project is related to the agromet package, that is call now [{agroclimatico}](https://github.com/AgRoMeteorologiaINTA/agroclimatico). The goad is to finish the peer review process of the package by February 2024!
